# Avery's Advent of Code

This repository contains my solutions for [Advent of Code][aoc].

### Licensing

This repository is licensed under the [MIT License][license-file].

### Contributing

This repository is **closed** for contributions. The intent is only to publish
my personal solutions, not to create a community-driven AoC agglomerate.

### Solution-Sets

I publish solutions for multiple years and in multiple languages. For each
combination of year and language there is a distinct "solution-set," that is,
the set of solutions for that year's AoC completed in that language. Within this
repository, solution-sets are referred to using a Year/Language notation; for
example, 2024/C23 is the solution-set for the 2024 problems written in C23.

### Directory Structure

The directory structure is organized first by year and then by language.
For example, 2024/C23 would be housed in `2024/c23/`. The internal directory
structure for a particular solution-set is bespoke.

Sometimes, it is useful for solution-sets in the same language but from
different years to share some common files. Such common files are housed in
`common/` - for instance, shared C23 files would be housed in `common/c23/`.

### Repository Structure

The repository has one primary branch (`trunk`) and a secondary branch for each
solution-set. The naming convention for secondary branches is `YEAR-LANGUAGE`.
